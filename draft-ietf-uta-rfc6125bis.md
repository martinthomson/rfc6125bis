--- abstract

Many application technologies enable secure communication between two entities
by means of Transport Layer Security (TLS) with
Internet Public Key Infrastructure Using X.509 (PKIX) certificates.
This document specifies
procedures for representing and verifying the identity of application services
in such interactions.

--- middle

# Introduction {#intro}

## Motivation {#motivation}

The visible face of the Internet largely consists of services that employ
a client-server architecture in which an interactive or automated client
communicates with an application service in order to retrieve or upload information,
communicate with other entities, or access a broader network of services.
When a client communicates with an application service using Transport Layer
Security {{TLS}} or Datagram Transport Layer Security {{DTLS}}, it
references some notion of the server's identity (e.g., "the website
at example.com") while attempting to establish secure communication.  Likewise,
during TLS negotiation, the server presents its notion of the service's identity
in the form of a public-key certificate that was issued by a certification
authority (CA) in the context of the Internet Public Key Infrastructure using
X.509 {{PKIX}}.  Informally, we can think of these identities as the client's "reference
identity" and the server's "presented identity" (these rough ideas are defined
more precisely later in this document through the concept of particular identifiers).
In general, a client needs to verify that the server's presented identity
matches its reference identity so it can authenticate the communication.

Many application technologies adhere to the pattern just outlined.  Such
protocols have traditionally specified their own rules for representing and
verifying application service identity.  Unfortunately, this divergence of
approaches has caused some confusion among certification authorities, application
developers, and protocol designers.

Therefore, to codify secure procedures for the implementation and deployment
of PKIX-based authentication, this document specifies recommended procedures
for representing and verifying application service identity in certificates
intended for use in application protocols employing TLS.

## Audience {#audience}

The primary audience for this document consists of application protocol designers,
who can reference this document instead of defining their own rules for the
representation and verification of application service identity.  Secondarily,
the audience consists of certification authorities, service providers, and
client developers from technology communities that might reuse the recommendations
in this document when defining certificate issuance policies, generating
certificate signing requests, or writing software algorithms for identity
matching.

## How to Read This Document {#reading}

This document is longer than the authors would have liked because it was
necessary to carefully define terminology, explain the underlying concepts,
define the scope, and specify recommended behavior for both certification
authorities and application software implementations.  The following sections
are of special interest to various audiences:

* Protocol designers might want to first read the checklist in {{design}}.

* Certification authorities might want to first read the recommendations for
  representation of server identity in {{represent}}.

* Service providers might want to first read the recommendations for requesting
  of server certificates in {{request}}.

* Software implementers might want to first read the recommendations for verification
  of server identity in {{verify}}.

The sections on terminology ({{terminology}}), naming of application
services ({{names}}), document scope ({{scope}}), and the like provide
useful background information regarding the recommendations
and guidelines that are contained in the above-referenced sections, but are
not absolutely necessary for a first reading of this document.

## Applicability {#applicability}

This document does not supersede the rules for certificate issuance or validation
provided in {{PKIX}}.  Therefore, {{PKIX}} is authoritative on any
point that might also be discussed in this document.
Furthermore, {{PKIX}} also governs any certificate-related topic on which this document is silent,
including but not limited to certificate syntax, certificate extensions such
as name constraints and extended key usage, and handling of certification
paths.

This document addresses only name forms in the leaf "end entity" server certificate,
not any name forms in the chain of certificates used to validate the server
certificate.  Therefore, in order to ensure proper authentication, application
clients need to verify the entire certification path per {{PKIX}}.

This document also does not supersede the rules for verifying service identity
provided in specifications for existing application protocols published prior
to this document.  However,
the procedures described here can be referenced by future
specifications,
including updates to specifications for existing application protocols if
the relevant technology communities agree to do so.

## Overview of Recommendations {#overview}

To orient the reader, this section provides an informational overview of
the recommendations contained in this document.

The previous version of this specification, {{VERIFY}},
surveyed the current practice from
many IETF standards and tried to generalize best practices.
This document takes the lessons learned in the past decade and codifies
them as best practices.

For the primary audience of application protocol designers, this document
provides recommended procedures for the representation and verification of
application service identity within PKIX certificates used in the context
of TLS.

For the secondary audiences, in essence this document encourages certification
authorities, application service providers, and application client developers
to coalesce on the following practices:

* Stop including and checking strings that look like domain names
  in the subject's Common Name.

* Check DNS domain names via the subjectAlternativeName
  extension designed for that purpose: dNSName.

* Move toward including and checking even more specific
  subjectAlternativeName extensions where appropriate for using the protocol
  (e.g., uniformResourceIdentifier and the otherName form SRVName).

* Constrain and simplify the validation of wildcard certificates
  (e.g., a certificate containing an identifier for `*.example.com`).

## Scope {#scope}

### In Scope {#in-scope}

This document applies only to service identities associated with
fully qualified DNS domain names, only to TLS and DTLS,
and only to PKIX-based systems.  As a result,
the scenarios described in the following section are out of scope for this
specification (although they might be addressed by future specifications).

### Out of Scope {#out-of-scope}

The following topics are out of scope for this specification:

* Client or end-user identities.

  Certificates representing client or end-user identities (e.g., the rfc822Name
  identifier) can be used for mutual authentication between a client and server
  or between two clients, thus enabling stronger client-server security or
  end-to-end security.  However, certification authorities, application developers,
  and service operators have less experience with client certificates than
  with server certificates, thus giving us fewer models from which to generalize
  and a less solid basis for defining best practices.

* Identifiers other than fully qualified DNS domain names.

  Some certification authorities issue server certificates based on IP addresses,
  but preliminary evidence indicates that such certificates are a very small
  percentage (less than 1%) of issued certificates.  Furthermore, IP addresses
  are not necessarily reliable identifiers for application services because
  of the existence of private internets {{PRIVATE}}, host mobility,
  multiple interfaces on a given host, Network Address Translators
  (NATs) resulting in different addresses for a host from different locations
  on the network, the practice of grouping many hosts together behind a single
  IP address, etc.  Most fundamentally, most users find DNS domain names much
  easier to work with than IP addresses, which is why the domain name system
  was designed in the first place.  We prefer to define best practices for
  the much more common use case and not to complicate the rules in
  this specification.

  Furthermore, we focus here on application service identities, not
  specific resources located at such services.
  Therefore this document discusses Uniform Resource Identifiers
  {{URI}} only as a way to communicate a DNS domain name (via the URI
  "host" component or its equivalent), not as a way to communicate
  other aspects of a service such as a specific resource (via the URI
  "path" component) or parameters (via the URI "query" component).

  We also do not discuss attributes unrelated to DNS domain names,
  such as those defined in {{X.520}} and other such specifications
  (e.g., organizational attributes, geographical attributes, company
  logos, and the like).

* Security protocols other than {{TLS}} or {{DTLS}}.

  Although other secure, lower-layer protocols exist and even employ
  PKIX certificates at times (e.g., IPsec {{IPSEC}}), their use cases
  can differ from those of TLS-based and DTLS-based application
  technologies.
  Furthermore, application technologies have less experience
  with IPsec than with TLS, thus making it more difficult to gather feedback
  on proposed best practices.

* Keys or certificates employed outside the context of PKIX-based systems.

  Some deployed application technologies use a web of trust model
  based on or similar to OpenPGP {{OPENPGP}}, or use self-signed
  certificates, or are deployed on networks that are not directly
  connected to the public Internet and therefore cannot depend on
  Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) or the Online Certificate Status
  Protocol {{OCSP}} to check CA-issued certificates.
  However, the method for binding a public key to an identifier in
  OpenPGP differs essentially from the method in X.509, the data in
  self-signed certificates has not been certified by a third party in
  any way, and checking of CA-issued certificates via CRLs or OCSP is
  critically important to maintaining the security of PKIX-based
  systems.
  Attempting to define best practices for such technologies would
  unduly complicate the rules defined in this specification.

* Certification authority policies, such as:

  * What types or "classes" of certificates to issue and whether to apply different
    policies for them.

  * Whether to issue certificates based on IP addresses (or
    some other form, such as relative domain names) in addition to fully qualified
    DNS domain names.

  * Which identifiers to include (e.g., whether to include SRV-IDs or URI-IDs
    as defined in the body of this specification).

  * How to certify or validate fully qualified DNS domain names and application
    service types.

  * How to certify or validate other kinds of information that might be included
    in a certificate (e.g., organization name).

* Resolution of DNS domain names.

  Although the process whereby a client resolves the DNS domain name
  of an application service can involve several steps (e.g., this is
  true of resolutions that depend on DNS SRV resource records, Naming
  Authority Pointer (NAPTR) DNS resource records {{NAPTR}}, and
  related technologies such as {{S-NAPTR}}), for our purposes we care
  only about the fact that the client needs to verify the identity of
  the entity with which it communicates as a result of the resolution
  process.
  Thus the resolution process itself is out of scope for this
  specification.

* User interface issues.

  In general, such issues are properly the responsibility of client
  software developers and standards development organizations
  dedicated to particular application technologies (see, for example,
  {{WSC-UI}}).

## Terminology {#terminology}

Because many concepts related to "identity" are often too vague to be actionable
in application protocols, we define a set of more concrete terms for use
in this specification.

application service:
: A service on the Internet that enables interactive and automated clients
  to connect for the purpose of retrieving or uploading information, communicating
  with other entities, or connecting to a broader network of services.

application service provider:
: An organization or individual that hosts or deploys an application service.

application service type:
: A formal identifier for the
  application protocol used to provide a particular kind of application service
  at a domain;
  the application service type typically takes the form of a Uniform Resource
  Identifier
  scheme {{URI}} or a DNS SRV Service {{DNS-SRV}}.

attribute-type-and-value pair:
: A colloquial name for the ASN.1-based construction comprising a Relative
  Distinguished Name (RDN), which itself is a building-block component of Distinguished
  Names. See {{LDAP-DN, Section 2}}.

automated client:
: A software agent or device that is not directly controlled by a human user.

delegated domain:
: A domain name or host name that is explicitly configured for communicating
  with the source domain, by either (a) the human user controlling an interactive
  client or (b) a trusted administrator.  In case (a), one example of delegation
  is an account setup that specifies the domain name of a particular host to
  be used for retrieving information or connecting to a network, which might
  be different from the server portion of the user's account name (e.g., a
  server at mailhost.example.com for connecting to an IMAP server hosting an
  email address of juliet@example.com).  In case (b), one example of delegation
  is an admin-configured host-to-address/address-to-host lookup table.

derived domain:
: A domain name or host name that a client has derived from the source domain
  in an automated fashion (e.g., by means of a {{DNS-SRV}} lookup).

identifier:
: A particular instance of an identifier type that is either presented by a
  server in a certificate or referenced by a client for matching purposes.

identifier type:
: A formally defined category of identifier that can be included in a certificate
  and therefore that can also be used for matching purposes.  For conciseness
  and convenience, we define the following identifier types of interest, which
  are based on those found in the PKIX specification {{PKIX}} and various PKIX extensions.

  * DNS-ID = a subjectAltName entry of type dNSName; see {{PKIX}}

  * SRV-ID = a subjectAltName entry of type otherName whose name form is SRVName;
    see {{SRVNAME}}

  * URI-ID = a subjectAltName entry of type uniformResourceIdentifier whose value
    includes both (i) a "scheme" and (ii) a "host" component (or its equivalent)
    that matches the "reg-name" rule (where the quoted terms represent
    the associated {{ABNF}} productions from {{URI}}); see {{PKIX}} and {{URI}}

interactive client:
: A software agent or device that is directly controlled by a human user.
  (Other specifications related to security and application protocols, such
  as {{WSC-UI}}, often refer to this entity as a "user agent".)

pinning:
: The act of establishing a cached name association between the application
  service's certificate and one of the client's reference identifiers, despite
  the fact that none of the presented identifiers matches the given reference
  identifier.  Pinning is accomplished by allowing a human user to positively
  accept the mismatch during an attempt to communicate with the application
  service.  Once a cached name association is established, the
  certificate is said to be pinned to the reference identifier and in
  future communication attempts the client simply verifies that the
  service's presented certificate matches the pinned certificate, as
  described under {{verify-outcome-pin}}.
  (A similar definition of "pinning" is provided in {{WSC-UI}}.)

PKIX:
: PKIX is a short name for the Internet Public Key Infrastructure using X.509
  defined in RFC 5280 [PKIX], which comprises a profile of the X.509v3 certificate
  specifications and X.509v2 certificate revocation list (CRL) specifications
  for use in the Internet.

PKIX-based system:
: A software implementation or deployed service that makes use of X.509v3 certificates
  and X.509v2 certificate revocation lists (CRLs).

PKIX certificate:
: An X.509v3 certificate generated and employed in the context of PKIX.

presented identifier:
: An identifier that is presented by a server to a client within a
  PKIX certificate when the client attempts to establish secure
  communication with the server; the certificate can include one or
  more presented identifiers of different types, and if the server
  hosts more than one domain then the certificate might present
  distinct identifiers for each domain.

reference identifier:
: An identifier, constructed from a source domain and optionally an
  application service type, used by the client for matching purposes
  when examining presented identifiers.

source domain:
: The fully qualified DNS domain name
  that a client expects an application service to present in the certificate
  (e.g., `www.example.com`), typically input by a human user, configured into
  a
  client, or provided by reference such as in a hyperlink.  The combination
  of a
  source domain and, optionally, an application service type enables a client
  to construct one or more reference identifiers.

subjectAltName entry:
: An identifier placed in a subjectAltName extension.

subjectAltName extension:
: A standard PKIX certificate extension {{PKIX}} enabling identifiers
  of various types to be bound to the certificate subject -- in
  addition to, or in place of, identifiers that may be embedded within
  or provided as a certificate's subject field.

subject field:
: The subject field of a PKIX certificate identifies the entity
  associated with the public key stored in the subject public key
  field (see {{PKIX, Section 4.1.2.6}}).

subject name:
: In an overall sense, a subject's name(s) can be represented by or in
  the subject field, the subjectAltName extension, or both (see
  {{PKIX}} for details).
  More specifically, the term often refers to the name of a PKIX
  certificate's subject, encoded as the X.501 type Name and conveyed
  in a certificate's subject field (see {{PKIX, Section 4.1.2.6}}).

TLS client:
: An entity that assumes the role of a client in a Transport Layer
  Security {{TLS}} negotiation. In this specification we generally
  assume that the TLS client is an (interactive or automated)
  application client; however, in application protocols that enable
  server-to-server communication, the TLS client could be a peer
  application service.

TLS server:
: An entity that assumes the role of a server in a Transport Layer
  Security {{TLS}} negotiation; in this specification we assume that
  the TLS server is an application service.

Most security-related terms in this document are to be understood in
the sense defined in {{SECTERMS}}; such terms include, but are not
limited to, "attack", "authentication", "authorization",
"certification authority", "certification path", "certificate",
"credential", "identity", "self-signed certificate", "trust", "trust
anchor", "trust chain", "validate", and "verify".

# Naming of Application Services {#names}

This section discusses naming of application services on the Internet, followed
by a brief tutorial about subject naming in PKIX.

## Naming Application Services {#names-apps}

This specification assumes that the name of an application service is
based on a DNS domain name (e.g., `example.com`) -- supplemented in
some circumstances by an application service type (e.g., "the IMAP
server at example.com").

From the perspective of the application client or user, some names
are direct because they are provided directly by a human user (e.g., via
runtime input, prior configuration, or explicit acceptance of a client
communication attempt), whereas other names are indirect because they are
automatically resolved by the client based on user input (e.g., a target
name
resolved from a source name using DNS SRV or NAPTR records). This dimension
matters most for certificate consumption, specifically verification as
discussed in this document.

From the perspective of the application service, some names are unrestricted
because they can be used in any type of service (e.g., a certificate might
be reused for both the HTTP service and the IMAP service at example.com),
whereas other names are restricted because they can be used in only one type
of service (e.g., a special-purpose certificate that can be used only for
an IMAP service).  This dimension matters most for certificate issuance.

Therefore, we can categorize the identifier types of interest as follows:

* A DNS-ID is direct and unrestricted.

* An SRV-ID is typically indirect but can be direct, and is restricted.

* A URI-ID is direct and restricted.

When implementing software, deploying services, and issuing certificates
for secure PKIX-based authentication, it is important to keep these distinctions
in mind.  In particular, best practices differ somewhat for application server
implementations, application client implementations, application service
providers, and certification authorities.  Ideally, protocol specifications
that reference this document will specify which identifiers are mandatory-to-implement
by servers and clients, which identifiers ought to be supported by certificate
issuers, and which identifiers ought to be requested by application service
providers.  Because these requirements differ across applications, it is
impossible to categorically stipulate universal rules (e.g., that all software
implementations, service providers, and certification authorities for all
application protocols need to use or support DNS-IDs as a baseline for the
purpose of interoperability).

However, it is preferable that each application protocol will at least define
a baseline that applies to the community of software developers, application
service providers, and CAs actively using or supporting that technology (one
such community, the CA/Browser Forum, has codified such a baseline for "Extended
Validation Certificates" in {{EV-CERTS}}).

## DNS Domain Names {#names-dns}

For the purposes of this specification, the name of an application service
is (or is based on) a DNS domain name that conforms to one of the following
forms:

1. A "traditional domain name", i.e., a fully qualified DNS domain
  name or "FQDN" (see {{DNS-CONCEPTS}}) all of whose labels are "LDH
  labels" as described in {{IDNA-DEFS}}.
  Informally, such labels are constrained to {{US-ASCII}} letters,
  digits, and the hyphen, with the hyphen prohibited in the first
  character position.
  Additional qualifications apply (please refer to the
  above-referenced specifications for details), but they are not
  relevant to this specification.

2. An "internationalized domain name", i.e., a DNS domain name that
  conforms to the overall form of a domain name (informally,
  dot-separated letter-digit-hyphen labels) but includes at least one
  label containing appropriately encoded Unicode code points outside
  the traditional US-ASCII range. That is, it contains at least one
  U-label or A-label, but otherwise may contain any mixture of NR-LDH
  labels, A-labels, or U-labels, as described in {{IDNA-DEFS}} and the
  associated documents.

## Subject Naming in PKIX Certificates {#names-pkix}

In theory, the Internet Public Key Infrastructure using X.509 {{PKIX}}
employs the global directory service model defined in {{X.500}} and
{{X.501}}.
Under that model, information is held in a directory information base
(DIB) and entries in the DIB are organized in a hierarchy called the
directory information tree (DIT).
An object or alias entry in that hierarchy consists of a set of
attributes (each of which has a defined type and one or more values)
and is uniquely identified by a Distinguished Name (DN).
The DN of an entry is constructed by combining the Relative
Distinguished Names of its superior entries in the tree (all the way
down to the root of the DIT) with one or more specially nominated
attributes of the entry itself (which together comprise the Relative
Distinguished Name (RDN) of the entry, so-called because it is
relative to the Distinguished Names of the superior entries in the
tree).
The entry closest to the root is sometimes referred to as the "most
significant" entry, and the entry farthest from the root is sometimes
referred to as the "least significant" entry.
An RDN is a set (i.e., an unordered group) of attribute-type-and-value
pairs (see also {{LDAP-DN}}), each of which asserts some attribute
about the entry.

In practice, the certificates used in {{X.509}} and {{PKIX}} borrow
key concepts from X.500 and X.501 (e.g., DNs and RDNs) to identify
entities, but such certificates are not necessarily part of a global
directory information base.
Specifically, the subject field of a PKIX certificate is an X.501 type
Name that "identifies the entity associated with the public key stored
in the subject public key field" (see {{PKIX, Section 4.1.2.6}}).
However, it is perfectly acceptable for the subject field to be empty,
as long as the certificate contains a subject alternative name
("subjectAltName") extension that includes at least one subjectAltName
entry, because the subjectAltName extension allows various identities
to be bound to the subject (see {{PKIX, Section 4.1.2.6}}).
The subjectAltName extension itself is a sequence of typed entries,
where each type is a distinct kind of identifier.

For our purposes, an application service can be identified by a name
or names carried in one or more of
the following identifier types within subjectAltName entries:

* DNS-ID

* SRV-ID

* URI-ID

The Common Name RDN should not be used to identify a service. Reasons
for this include:

* It is not strongly typed and therefore suffers from ambiguities
  in interpretation.

* It can appear more than once in the Subject Name.

Likewise, other RDN's within the Subject Name SHOULD NOT be used to
identify a service.

# Designing Application Protocols {#design}

This section provides guidelines for designers of application protocols,
in the form of a checklist to follow when reusing the recommendations provided
in this document.

* Does your technology use DNS SRV records to resolve the DNS domain
  names of application services?
  If so, consider recommending or requiring support for the SRV-ID
  identifier type in PKIX certificates issued and used in your
  technology community.
  (Note that many existing application technologies use DNS SRV
  records to resolve the DNS domain names of application services, but
  do not rely on representations of those records in PKIX certificates
  by means of SRV-IDs as defined in {{SRVNAME}}.)

* Does your technology use URIs to identify application services?
  If so, consider recommending or requiring support for the URI-ID
  identifier type.
  (Note that many existing application technologies use URIs to
  identify application services, but do not rely on representation of
  those URIs in PKIX certificates by means of URI-IDs.)

# Representing Server Identity {#represent}

This section provides rules and guidelines for issuers of
certificates.

## Rules {#represent-rules}

When a certification authority issues a certificate based on the fully
qualified DNS domain name at which the application service provider
will provide the relevant application, the following rules apply to
the representation of application service identities.
The reader needs to be aware that some of these rules are cumulative
and can interact in important ways that are illustrated later in this
document.

1. The certificate SHOULD include a "DNS-ID" if possible as a baseline
   for interoperability.

2. If the service using the certificate deploys a technology for which
  the relevant specification stipulates that certificates ought to
  include identifiers of type SRV-ID (e.g., this is true of {{XMPP}}),
  then the certificate SHOULD include an SRV-ID.

3. If the service using the certificate deploys a technology for which
  the relevant specification stipulates that certificates ought to
  include identifiers of type URI-ID (e.g., this is true of {{SIP}} as
  specified by {{SIP-CERTS}}, but not true of {{HTTP}} since
  {{HTTP-TLS}} does not describe usage of a URI-ID for HTTP services),
  then the certificate SHOULD include a URI-ID.
  The scheme SHALL be that of the protocol associated with the
  application service type and the "host" component (or its
  equivalent) SHALL be the fully qualified DNS domain name of the
  service.
  A specification that reuses this one MUST specify which URI schemes
  are to be considered acceptable in URI-IDs contained in PKIX
  certificates used for the application protocol (e.g., `sip` but not
  `sips` or `tel` for SIP as described in {{SIP-SIPS}}, or perhaps
  http and https for HTTP as might be described in a future
  specification).

4. The certificate MAY include other application-specific identifiers
  for types that were defined before publication of {{SRVNAME}} (e.g.,
  XmppAddr for {{XMPP}}) or for which service names or URI schemes do
  not exist; however, such application-specific identifiers are not
  applicable to all application technologies and therefore are out of
  scope for this specification.

5. The certificate MAY contain more than one DNS-ID, SRV-ID, or URI-ID
  as further explained under {{security-multi}}.

## Examples {#represent-examples}

Consider a simple website at `www.example.com`, which is not
discoverable via DNS SRV lookups.
Because HTTP does not specify the use of URIs in server certificates,
a certificate for this service might include only a DNS-ID of
`www.example.com`.

Consider an IMAP-accessible email server at the host
`mail.example.net` servicing email addresses of the form
`user@example.net` and discoverable via DNS SRV lookups on the
application service name of `example.net`.
A certificate for this service might include SRV-IDs of
`_imap.example.net` and `_imaps.example.net` (see {{EMAIL-SRV}}) along
with DNS-IDs of `example.net` and `mail.example.net`.

Consider a SIP-accessible voice-over-IP (VoIP) server at the host
`voice.example.edu` servicing SIP addresses of the form
`user@voice.example.edu` and identified by a URI of
\<sip:voice.example.edu>.
A certificate for this service would include a URI-ID of
`sip:voice.example.edu` (see {{SIP-CERTS}}) along with a DNS-ID of
`voice.example.edu`.

Consider an XMPP-compatible instant messaging (IM) server at the host
`im.example.org` servicing IM addresses of the form
`user@im.example.org` and discoverable via DNS SRV lookups on the
`im.example.org` domain.
A certificate for this service might include SRV-IDs of
`_xmpp-client.im.example.org` and
`_xmpp-server.im.example.org` (see {{XMPP}}), a DNS-ID of
`im.example.org`, and an XMPP-specific `XmppAddr` of `im.example.org`
(see {{XMPP}}).

# Requesting Server Certificates {#request}

This section provides rules and guidelines for service providers regarding
the information to include in certificate signing requests (CSRs).

In general, service providers are encouraged to request certificates that
include all of the identifier types that are required or recommended for
the application service type that will be secured using the certificate to
be issued.

If the certificate might be used for any type of application service, then
the service provider is encouraged to request a certificate that includes
only a DNS-ID.

If the certificate will be used for only a single type of application
service, then the service provider is encouraged to request a certificate
that
includes a DNS-ID and, if appropriate for the application service type, an
SRV-ID or URI-ID
that limits the deployment scope of the certificate to only the defined
application service type.

If a service provider offering multiple application service types
(e.g., a World Wide Web service, an email service, and an instant
messaging service) wishes to limit the applicability of certificates
using SRV-IDs or URI-IDs, then the service provider is encouraged to
request multiple certificates, i.e., one certificate per application
service type. Conversely, the service provider is discouraged from
requesting a single certificate containing multiple SRV-IDs or URI-IDs
identifying each different application service type.
This guideline does not apply to application service type "bundles"
that are used to identify manifold distinct access methods to the same
underlying application (e.g., an email application with access methods
denoted by the application service types of `imap`, `imaps`, `pop3`,
`pop3s`, and `submission` as described in {{EMAIL-SRV}}).

# Verifying Service Identity {#verify}

This section provides rules and guidelines for implementers of application
client software regarding algorithms for verification of application service
identity.

## Overview {#verify-overview}

At a high level, the client verifies the application service's
identity by performing the actions listed below (which are defined in
the following subsections of this document):

1. The client constructs a list of acceptable reference identifiers
  based on the source domain and, optionally, the type of service to
  which the client is connecting.

2. The server provides its identifiers in the form of a PKIX
   certificate.

3. The client checks each of its reference identifiers against the
  presented identifiers for the purpose of finding a match.

4. When checking a reference identifier against a presented
  identifier, the client matches the source domain of the identifiers
  and, optionally, their application service type.

Naturally, in addition to checking identifiers, a client might
complete further checks to ensure that the server is authorized to
provide the requested service.
However, such checking is not a matter of verifying the application
service identity presented in a certificate, and therefore methods for
doing so (e.g., consulting local policy information) are out of scope
for this document.

## Constructing a List of Reference Identifiers {#verify-reference}

### Rules {#verify-reference-rules}

The client MUST construct a list of acceptable reference identifiers,
and MUST do so independently of the identifiers presented by the
service.

The inputs used by the client to construct its list of reference
identifiers might be a URI that a user has typed into an interface
(e.g., an HTTPS URL for a website), configured account information
(e.g., the domain name of a particular host or URI used for retrieving
information or connecting to a network, which might be different from
the DNS domain name portion of a username), a hyperlink in a web page
that triggers a browser to retrieve a media object or script, or some
other combination of information that can yield a source domain and an
application service type.

The client might need to extract the source domain and application
service type from the input(s) it has received.
The extracted data MUST include only information that can be securely
parsed out of the inputs (e.g., parsing the fully qualified DNS domain
name out of the "host" component (or its equivalent) of a URI or
deriving the application service type from the scheme of a URI) or
information that is derived in a manner not subject to subversion by
network attackers (e.g., pulling the data from a delegated domain that
is explicitly established via client or system configuration,
resolving the data via {{DNSSEC}}, or obtaining the data from a
third-party domain mapping service in which a human user has
explicitly placed trust and with which the client communicates over a
connection or association that provides both mutual authentication and
integrity checking).
These considerations apply only to extraction of the source domain
from the inputs; naturally, if the inputs themselves are invalid or
corrupt (e.g., a user has clicked a link provided by a malicious
entity in a phishing attack), then the client might end up
communicating with an unexpected application service.

> Example: Given an input URI of \<sips:alice@example.net>, a client
> would derive the application service type `sip` from the "scheme"
> and parse the domain name `example.net` from the "host" component
> (or its equivalent).

Each reference identifier in the list SHOULD be based on the source
domain and SHOULD NOT be based on a derived domain (e.g., a host name
or domain name discovered through DNS resolution of the source
domain).
This rule is important because only a match between the user inputs
and a presented identifier enables the client to be sure that the
certificate can legitimately be used to secure the client's
communication with the server.
There is only one scenario in which it is acceptable for an
interactive client to override the recommendation in this rule and
therefore communicate with a domain name other than the source domain:
because a human user has "pinned" the application service's
certificate to the alternative domain name as further discussed under
{{verify-outcome-fallback}} and {{security-pinning}}.
In this case, the inputs used by the client to construct its list of
reference identifiers might include more than one fully qualified DNS
domain name, i.e., both (a) the source domain and (b) the alternative
domain contained in the pinned certificate.

Using the combination of fully qualified DNS domain name(s) and
application service type, the client constructs a list of reference identifiers
in accordance with the following rules:

* The list SHOULD include a DNS-ID.
  A reference identifier of type DNS-ID can be directly constructed
  from a fully qualified DNS domain name that is (a) contained in or
  securely derived from the inputs (i.e., the source domain), or (b)
  explicitly associated with the source domain by means of user
  configuration (i.e., a derived domain).

* If a server for the application service type is typically discovered
  by means of DNS SRV records, then the list SHOULD include an SRV-ID.

* If a server for the application service type is typically associated
  with a URI for security purposes (i.e., a formal protocol document
  specifies the use of URIs in server certificates), then the list
  SHOULD include a URI-ID.

Which identifier types a client includes in its list of reference
identifiers is a matter of local policy.
For example, in certain deployment environments, a client that is
built to connect only to a particular kind of service (e.g., only IM
services) might be configured to accept as valid only certificates
that include an SRV-ID for that application service type; in this
case, the client would include only SRV-IDs matching the application
service type in its list of reference identifiers (not, for example,
DNS-IDs).
By contrast, a more lenient client (even one built to connect only
to a particular kind of service) might include both SRV-IDs and
DNS-IDs in its list of reference identifiers.

> Implementation Note: The client does not need to construct the foregoing
> identifiers in the actual formats found in a certificate (e.g., as ASN.1
> types); it only needs to construct the functional equivalent of such identifiers
> for matching purposes.

### Examples {#verify-reference-examples}

A web browser that is connecting via HTTPS to the website at `www.example.com`
would have a single reference identifier: a DNS-ID of `www.example.com`.

A mail user agent that is connecting via IMAPS to the email
service at `example.net` (resolved as `mail.example.net`) might have three
reference identifiers: an SRV-ID of `_imaps.example.net` (see {{EMAIL-SRV}}),
and DNS-IDs of `example.net` and `mail.example.net`.
(A legacy email user agent would
not support {{EMAIL-SRV}} and therefore would probably be explicitly configured to
connect to `mail.example.net`, whereas an SRV-aware user agent would derive
`example.net` from an email address of the form `user@example.net` but might
also accept `mail.example.net` as the DNS domain name portion of reference
identifiers for the service.)

A voice-over-IP (VoIP) user agent that is connecting via SIP to the voice
service at `voice.example.edu` might have only one reference identifier:
a URI-ID of `sip:voice.example.edu` (see {{SIP-CERTS}}).

An instant messaging (IM) client that is connecting via XMPP to the IM
service at `im.example.org` might have three reference identifiers: an
SRV-ID of `_xmpp-client.im.example.org` (see {{XMPP}}), a DNS-ID of
`im.example.org`, and an XMPP-specific `XmppAddr` of `im.example.org`
(see {{XMPP}}).

## Preparing to Seek a Match {#verify-seek}

Once the client has constructed its list of reference identifiers and has
received the server's presented identifiers in the form of a PKIX certificate,
the client checks its reference identifiers against the presented identifiers
for the purpose of finding a match.  The search fails if the client exhausts
its list of reference identifiers without finding a match.  The search succeeds
if any presented identifier matches one of the reference identifiers, at
which point the client SHOULD stop the search.

> Implementation Note: A client might be configured to perform
> multiple searches, i.e., to match more than one reference
> identifier.
> Although such behavior is not forbidden by this specification, rules
> for matching multiple reference identifiers are a matter for
> implementation or future specification.

Before applying the comparison rules provided in the following
sections, the client might need to split the reference identifier into
its DNS domain name portion and its application service type portion,
as follows:

* A reference identifier of type DNS-ID does not include an
  application service type portion and thus can be used directly as the DNS
  domain name for comparison purposes.  As an example, a DNS-ID of `www.example.com`
  would result in a DNS domain name portion of `www.example.com`.

* For a reference identifier of type SRV-ID, the DNS domain name
  portion is the Name and the application service type portion is the Service.
  As an example, an SRV-ID of `_imaps.example.net` would be split into a DNS
  domain name portion of `example.net` and an application service type portion
  of `imaps` (mapping to an application protocol of IMAP as explained in {{EMAIL-SRV}}).

* For a reference identifier of type URI-ID, the DNS domain name
  portion is the "reg-name" part of the "host" component (or its
  equivalent) and the application service type portion is the
  application service type associated with the scheme name matching
  the {{ABNF}} "scheme" rule from {{URI}} (not including the ':'
  separator).
  As previously mentioned, this document specifies that a URI-ID
  always contains a "host" component (or its equivalent) containing a
  "reg-name".
  (Matching only the "reg-name" rule from {{URI}} limits verification
  to DNS domain names, thereby differentiating a URI-ID from a
  uniformResourceIdentifier entry that contains an IP address or a
  mere host name, or that does not contain a "host" component at all.)
  Furthermore, note that extraction of the "reg-name" might
  necessitate normalization of the URI (as explained in {{URI}}).
  As an example, a URI-ID of `sip:voice.example.edu` would be split
  into a DNS domain name portion of `voice.example.edu` and an
  application service type of `sip` (associated with an application
  protocol of SIP as explained in {{SIP-CERTS}}).

Detailed comparison rules for matching the DNS domain name portion
and application service type portion of the reference identifier are provided
in the following sections.

## Matching the DNS Domain Name Portion {#verify-domain}

The client MUST match the DNS domain name portion of a reference
identifier according to the following rules (and SHOULD also check the
application service type as described under {{verify-app}}).
The rules differ depending on whether the domain to be checked is a
"traditional domain name" or an "internationalized domain name" (as
defined under {{names-dns}}).
Furthermore, to meet the needs of clients that support presented
identifiers containing the wildcard character `*`, we define a
supplemental rule for so-called "wildcard certificates".

### Checking of Traditional Domain Names {#verify-domain-trad}

If the DNS domain name portion of a reference identifier is a
"traditional domain name", then matching of the reference identifier
against the presented identifier is performed by comparing the set of
domain name labels using a case-insensitive ASCII comparison, as
clarified by {{DNS-CASE}} (e.g., `WWW.Example.Com` would be
lower-cased to `www.example.com` for comparison purposes).
Each label MUST match in order for the names to be considered to
match, except as supplemented by the rule about checking of wildcard
labels ({{verify-domain-wildcards}}).

### Checking of Internationalized Domain Names {#verify-domain-idn}

If the DNS domain name portion of a reference identifier is an
internationalized domain name, then an implementation MUST convert any
U-labels {{IDNA-DEFS}} in the domain name to A-labels before checking
the domain name.
In accordance with {{IDNA-PROTO}}, A-labels MUST be compared as
case-insensitive ASCII.
Each label MUST match in order for the domain names to be considered
to match, except as supplemented by the rule about checking of
wildcard labels ({{verify-domain-wildcards}}; but see also
{{security-wildcards}} regarding wildcards in internationalized domain
names).

### Checking of Wildcard Certificates {#verify-domain-wildcards}

A client MAY match the
reference identifier against a presented identifier whose DNS domain name
portion contains the wildcard character `*` in a label
(following the description of labels and domain names in {{DNS-CONCEPTS}}),
provided these requirements are met:

1. There is only one wildcard character.

2. The wildcard character appears only as the content of the
   left-most label.

3. The wildcard character is not embedded in an A-label or U-label
   {{IDNA-DEFS}} of an internationalized domain name {{IDNA-PROTO}}.

For information regarding the security characteristics of wildcard certificates,
see {{security-wildcards}}.

## Matching the Application Service Type Portion {#verify-app}

When a client checks identifiers of type SRV-ID and URI-ID, it MUST
check not only the DNS domain name portion of the identifier but also
the application service type portion.
The client does this by splitting the identifier into the DNS domain
name portion and the application service type portion (as described
under {{verify-seek}}), then checking both the DNS domain name portion
(as described under {{verify-domain}}) and the application service
type portion as described in the following subsections.

Implementation Note: An identifier of type SRV-ID or URI-ID provides an
application service type portion to be checked, but that portion is combined
only with the DNS domain name portion of the SRV-ID or URI-ID itself.  For
example, if a client's list of reference identifiers includes an SRV-ID of
`_xmpp-client.im.example.org` and a DNS-ID of `apps.example.net`, the client
would check (a) the combination of an application service type of
`xmpp-client` and a DNS domain name of `im.example.org` and (b) a DNS domain
name of `apps.example.net`.  However, the client would not check (c) the
combination of an application service type of `xmpp-client` and a DNS domain
name of `apps.example.net` because it does not have an SRV-ID of
`_xmpp-client.apps.example.net` in its list of reference identifiers.

### SRV-ID {#verify-app-srv}

The application service name portion of an SRV-ID (e.g., `imaps`) MUST
be matched in a case-insensitive manner, in accordance with
{{DNS-SRV}}.
Note that the `_` character is prepended to the service identifier in
DNS SRV records and in SRV-IDs (per {{SRVNAME}}), and thus does not
need to be included in any comparison.

### URI-ID {#verify-app-uri}

The scheme name portion of a URI-ID (e.g., `sip`) MUST be matched in a
case-insensitive manner, in accordance with {{URI}}.
Note that the `:` character is a separator between the scheme name
and the rest of the URI, and thus does not need to be included in any
comparison.

## Outcome {#verify-outcome}

The outcome of the matching procedure is one of the following cases.

### Case #1: Match Found {#verify-outcome-matched}

If the client has found a presented identifier that matches a reference identifier,
then the service identity check has succeeded.  In this case, the client
MUST use the matched reference identifier as the validated identity of the
application service.

### Case #2: No Match Found, Pinned Certificate {#verify-outcome-pin}

If the client does not find a presented identifier matching any of the
reference identifiers but the client has previously pinned the
application service's certificate to one of the reference identifiers
in the list it constructed for this communication attempt (as
"pinning" is explained under {{terminology}}), and the presented
certificate matches the pinned certificate (including the context as
described under {{security-pinning}}), then the service identity check
has succeeded.

### Case #3: No Match Found, No Pinned Certificate {#verify-outcome-nopin}

If the client does not find a presented identifier matching any of the
reference identifiers and the client has not previously pinned the
certificate to one of the reference identifiers in the list it
constructed for this communication attempt, then the client MUST
proceed as described under {{verify-outcome-fallback}}.

### Fallback {#verify-outcome-fallback}

If the client is an interactive client that is directly controlled by a human
user, then it SHOULD inform the user of the identity mismatch and automatically
terminate the communication attempt with a bad certificate error; this behavior
is preferable because it prevents users from inadvertently bypassing security
protections in hostile situations.

> Security Warning: Some interactive clients give advanced users the option
> of proceeding with acceptance despite the identity mismatch, thereby "pinning"
> the certificate to one of the reference identifiers in the list constructed
> by the client for this communication attempt.  Although this behavior can
> be appropriate in certain specialized circumstances, in general it ought
> to be exposed only to advanced users.  Even then it needs to be handled with
> extreme caution, for example by first encouraging even an advanced user to
> terminate the communication attempt and, if the advanced user chooses to
> proceed anyway, by forcing the user to view the entire certification path
> and only then allowing the user to pin the certificate (on a temporary or
> permanent basis, at the user's option).

Otherwise, if the client is an automated application not directly controlled
by a human user, then it SHOULD terminate the communication attempt with
a bad certificate error and log the error appropriately.  An automated application
MAY provide a configuration setting that disables this behavior, but MUST
enable the behavior by default.

# Security Considerations {#security}

## Pinned Certificates {#security-pinning}

As defined under {{terminology}}, a certificate is said
to be "pinned" to a DNS domain name when a user has explicitly chosen to
associate a service's certificate with that DNS domain name despite the fact
that the certificate contains some other DNS domain name (e.g., the user
has
explicitly approved `apps.example.net` as a domain associated with a source
domain of `example.com`).  The cached name association MUST take account
of
both the certificate presented and the context in which it was accepted or
configured (where the "context" includes the chain of certificates from the
presented certificate to the trust anchor, the source domain, the application
service type, the service's derived domain and port number, and any other
relevant information provided by the user or associated by the client).

## Wildcard Certificates {#security-wildcards}

Wildcard certificates, those that have an identifier with
`*` as the left-most DNS label,
automatically vouch for any and all host names
within their domain. This can be convenient for administrators but
also poses the risk of vouching for rogue or buggy hosts. See for
example {{Defeating-SSL}} (beginning at slide 91) and {{HTTPSbytes}}
(slides 38-40).

Protection against a wildcard that identifies a
so-called "public suffix" (e.g., `*.co.uk` or `*.com`)
is beyond the scope of this document.

## Internationalized Domain Names {#security-idn}

Allowing internationalized domain names can lead to the inclusion of visually
similar (so-called "confusable") characters in certificates; for discussion,
see for example {{IDNA-DEFS}}.

## Multiple Identifiers {#security-multi}

A given application service might be addressed by multiple DNS domain names
for a variety of reasons, and a given deployment might service multiple domains
or protocols.
The client SHOULD use the TLS Server Name Identification (SNI) extension
as discussed in {{TLS, Section 4.4.2.2}}.

To accommodate the workaround that was needed before the development
of the SNI extension, this specification allows multiple DNS-IDs,
SRV-IDs, or URI-IDs in a certificate.

# Sample Text {#text}

At the time of this writing, two application technologies reuse the
recommendations in this specification: email {{EMAIL-SRV}} and XMPP
{{XMPP}}.
Here we include the text from {{XMPP}} to illustrate the thought
process that might be followed by protocol designers for other
application technologies.
Specifically, because XMPP uses DNS SRV records for resolution of the
DNS domain names for application services, the XMPP specification
recommends the use of SRV-IDs.

The text regarding certificate issuance is as follows:

######

In a PKIX certificate to be presented by an XMPP server (i.e., a "server
certificate"), the certificate MUST include one or more XMPP addresses (i.e.,
domainparts) associated with XMPP services hosted at the server.  The rules
and guidelines defined in this specification apply to XMPP server certificates,
with the following XMPP-specific considerations:

* Support for the DNS-ID identifier type {{PKIX}} is REQUIRED in XMPP
  client and server software implementations.
  Certification
  authorities that issue XMPP-specific certificates MUST support the DNS-ID
  identifier type.
  XMPP service providers SHOULD include the DNS-ID identifier type in
  certificate requests.

* Support for the SRV-ID identifier type {{SRVNAME}} is REQUIRED for
  XMPP client and server software implementations (for verification
  purposes XMPP client implementations need to support only the
  `_xmpp-client` application service type, whereas XMPP server
  implementations need to support both the `_xmpp-client` and
  `_xmpp-server` application service types).
  Certification authorities that issue XMPP-specific certificates
  SHOULD support the SRV-ID identifier type.
  XMPP service providers SHOULD include the SRV-ID identifier type in
  certificate requests.

* Support for the XmppAddr identifier type is encouraged in XMPP
  client and server software implementations for the sake of
  backward-compatibility, but is no longer encouraged in certificates
  issued by certification authorities or requested by XMPP service
  providers.

* DNS domain names in server certificates MAY contain the wildcard
  character `*` as the complete left-most label within the
  identifier.

######

The text regarding certificate verification is as follows:

######

For server certificates, the rules and guidelines defined in this specification
apply, with the proviso that the XmppAddr identifier is allowed as a reference
identifier.

The identities to be checked are set as follows:

* The initiating entity sets its reference identifier to the 'to' address it
  communicates in the initial stream header; i.e., this is the identity it
  expects the receiving entity to provide in a PKIX certificate.

* The receiving entity sets its reference identifier to the 'from' address
  communicated by the initiating entity in the initial stream header; i.e.,
  this is the identity that the initiating entity is trying to assert.
